## Scala Assessment

#### Q1. Scala bytecode can run on top of Java VM. What is the fundamental difference between Java object.clone() and Scala object.copy()?

- [ ] One is a Java object, the other is a Scala object.
- [ ] clone() will copy class structures but not the data, while copy() will also copy data into new objects.
- [ ] There is no difference.
- [x] copy() allows you to change values during the copying process; clone() does not.

#### Q2. What value does this code return?

```scala
val m1 = Map("a"->1,"b"->2,"c"->3)
m1("a")
```

- [ ] a
- [ ] 2
- [ ] b
- [x] 1

#### Q3. What is one way to avoid low-level parallelization details?

- [ ] monads
- [ ] literal functions
- [ ] partially applied functions
- [x] parallel collections

#### Q4. What do you use in ScalaTest to see a detailed diagram of error messages when a test fails?

- [ ] ArgumentExceptions
- [ ] AssertionException
- [x] DiagrammedAssertions
- [ ] JUnit

#### Q5. What data type would you use to store an immutable collection of objects that contain a fixed number of varying types?

- [ ] Array
- [ ] ImmutableCollection
- [ ] List
- [x] Tuple

#### Q6. After defining a function in the interpreter, Scala returns the following. What does the

```scala
myfnc: ()Unit
```

- [ ] The function has no side effects.
- [ ] The function takes no parameters.
- [x] The function returns no value.
- [ ] Returning unit types to the function is a closures.

#### Q7. What type of number is 1234.e5?

- [ ] hexadecimal
- [ ] short
- [x] floating point
- [ ] long

#### Q8. When you convert a map to a list using the toList method of the map, the result will be of which type?

- [ ] List[(String, String)]
- [ ] List[(Array, Array)]
- [ ] List[(Array, Array)]
- [x] List

#### Q9. What type of object does this code create?

```scala
val x = (1234, "Active")
```

- [ ] List
- [ ] Map
- [x] Tuple
- [ ] Array

#### Q10. Which is a subclass of all classes?

- [ ] AnyVal
- [ ] AnyRef
- [ ] Method
- [x] Null NOT SURE

#### Q11. For the for-yield construct, is the scope separate between for-body and yield-body?

- [x] Yes and no. It is different depending on the for construct and what it does. NOT SURE
- [ ] Yes, because the for section does not expose its scope.
- [ ] No, because for-yield shares the same scope, even though they are within separate curly braces.
- [ ] Yes, because they are within different curly braces.

#### Q12. What is one way to implement pattern matching on methods?

- [ ] using regex
- [ ] using monads
- [x] using string matching
- [ ] using case classes

#### Q13. What is the value of z after executing this code?

```scala
val y = List('a','b')
val z = y::List('c')
```

- [ ] List(a,b,c)
- [x] List(List(a, b), c)
- [ ] List(c,a,b)
- [ ] List(c,List(a,b))

#### Q14. What term is used to specify a precondition?

- [x] assert
- [ ] require
- [ ] precondition
- [ ] mustHave

#### Q15. Which Scala type may throw an exception or a successfully computed value, and is commonly used to trap and propagate errors?

##### answers missing

Answer should be Option: Some or None

#### Q16. What is the data type of y after this code is executed?

```scala
val y = (math floor 3.1415 * 2)
```

- [ ] short
- [x] double
- [ ] int
- [ ] bigInt

#### Q17. When using pattern matching, which character matches on any object?

- [ ] %
- [ ] \_
- [ ] ^
- [x] -

#### Q18. You have created an array using val. Can you change the value of any element of the arrayâ€”and why or why not?

- [ ] Yes, the reference to the array is immutable, so the location that the array points to is immutable. The values in the array are mutable.
- [ ] The 0th element is immutable and cannot be modified. All other elements can be modified.
- [x] Yes, val does not make arrays immutable.
- [ ] No, val makes the array and values of the array immutable.

#### Q19. What is the output of this function?

```scala
def main () {
     var a = 0
     for (a<-1 until 5){println(a)}
```

- [ ] 1,2,3,4,5
- [ ] 0,1,2,3,4
- [x] 1,2,3,4
- [ ] 2,3,4,5

#### Q20. What do you call objects with immutable state?

- [x] singletons
- [ ] stationary objects
- [ ] functional objects
- [ ] fixed objects

#### Q21. You have written a Scala script. How would you access command-line arguments in the script?

- [x] use array named args
- [ ] use tuple named args
- [ ] use numbered variables with a _ prefix for example _ 1, _ 2, _ 3
- [ ] use numbered variables with a $ prefix - for example $1, $2, $3

#### Q22. What does this code return? val x = 3; if (x >2) x = 4 else x = x\*2

- [ ] 4
- [x] an error
- [ ] 6
- [ ] 3

#### Q23. Which statement returns a success or a failure indicator when you execute this code?

val MyFuture = Future {runBackgroundFunction() }

- [x] myFuture.onComplete
- [ ] myFuture(status)
- [ ] myFuture.Finished
- [ ] complete(myFuture)

#### Q24. To denote a parameter that may be repeated, what should you place after type?

- [ ] %
- [ ] &
- [ ] \_
- [x] -

#### Q25. What is called when a superclass has more than one subclass in Scala?

- [ ] polyinheritance
- [ ] multilevel inheritance
- [ ] multimode inheritance
- [x] hierarchical inheritance
